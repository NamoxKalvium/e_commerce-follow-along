This project will guide you through building a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). You will learn how to implement key functionalities such as *user authentication, **product management, and *order handling while gaining hands-on experience with REST APIs, database schema design, and frontend development with React.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure login and registration with JWT.
Product Management: CRUD operations for products, with features like filtering and sorting.
Order Handling: Users can place and view orders.
REST API: Build scalable API endpoints for managing users, products, and orders.
Frontend: Responsive UI built with React for a smooth user experience.
Core Concepts:
MERN Stack: Using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for full-stack development.
REST APIs: Design and develop API endpoints for user and product management.
Authentication: Implement secure login and session management.
Database Schema: Design MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders.
Next Steps:
Set up the development environment and install dependencies.
Implement a basic server using Node.js and Express.
Start building the React frontend and connect it to the backend.
Design MongoDB schemas for structured data storage.
This project will help you master the full-stack development process, from database to frontend, with a focus on scalability and user interaction.


Here‚Äôs a README.md file template for Milestone 1 of your E-Commerce Application project:

E-Commerce Application - Follow Along Project: Milestone 1
Overview
Welcome to Milestone 1 of the E-Commerce Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). In this milestone, we focus on setting up the overall structure of the project and preparing for upcoming milestones.

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts, including building scalable REST APIs, user authentication, database schema design, and backend development using Node.js and Express.

Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Understand the overall structure of a MERN project.
Learn the foundational steps of setting up a new project repository.
Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.
Prepare for future milestones by setting up the project repository.
Key Features of the Project
MERN Stack: The project will be built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
REST API Creation: Learn how to build scalable APIs for the application.
User Authentication: Implement secure login and registration functionalities.
Database Schema Design: Create structured data models using MongoDB.
Backend Development: Set up robust server-side logic using Node.js and Express.
Frontend Development: Use React.js to build the frontend of the e-commerce application.
What to Expect in This Milestone
This milestone will be a mentor-led session where we will:

Explain the overall vision, goals, and key features of the e-commerce application.
Provide a live demonstration of the completed application, showcasing its functionality, user interface, and backend integration.
Core Concepts Covered
1. Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications. It uses a JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application (both front-end and back-end). This streamlines development and makes it easy for newbies.

2. REST API Structure and Endpoints
In this project, we will build various API endpoints to handle:

User Authentication: Register and log in users.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders.
Each API will interact with the database and serve data in JSON format.

3. Basics of Database Schema Design
In MongoDB, schema design defines the structure and relationships of data. In this milestone, we‚Äôll be working on the foundational aspects of schema design for our application.

4. Role of Authentication in Web Applications
User authentication is the process of verifying a user‚Äôs identity before granting access to sensitive resources. In our e-commerce app, users will need to authenticate before making purchases or accessing their accounts.

Submission Guidelines üì•
Push your code to GitHub and make sure the repository is publicly accessible.
Include a README file with a brief description of the project and a summary of Milestone 1.
Share the GitHub repository link in the assignment submission section provided.
Next Steps üöÄ
In the next milestone, we will:

Set up the development environment for the MERN stack.
Learn about server-client interaction using APIs.
Create a simple server using Node.js and Express to lay the foundation for the project.

Milestone 2
Created a structured folder hierarchy for the project.
Set up a React app for the frontend.
Set up a Node.js server for the backend.
Configured Tailwind CSS for streamlined styling.
Added optional extensions for improving development efficiency.
Built a functional and styled Login Page for the frontend.

Milestone 3
Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively.
Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests.
Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage data.
Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation




E-Commerce Backend - Milestone 4
Overview
In this milestone, we focused on creating a User Model, setting up controllers to handle user data, and enabling file uploads using Multer.

Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Create a User Model to define how user data is stored.
Set up a User Controller to manage user-related actions.
Enable file uploads with Multer for storing user files (e.g., profile pictures).
Key Concepts
Model: Defines the structure of data (e.g., user details) in the database.
Controller: Manages data flow, like handling user signups and fetching user info.
Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads in the backend.
Completed Steps üìù
User Model: Defined user data structure in MongoDB using Mongoose.
User Controller: Created functions to handle user signup and data retrieval.
File Uploads: Configured Multer to handle and store files like profile pictures.
Submission Guidelines üì•
Push your code to the GitHub repository.
Ensure the repository is public.
Update your README with Milestone 4 progress.
Share your repository link in the assignment submission section.

Welcome to Milestone 6! üåü

In the last lesson, we created the signup page.

Today we are going to create a backend endpoint for the Signup page to store all user data securely. In this, we are going to encrypt the password and store the user's data‚Äîincluding all relevant details‚Äîin the database.

Let‚Äôs dive in and understand what this all means!

Learning goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Understand how to encrypt the passwords before saving.
Know how to store complete user data securely in the database.
Why encrypting passwords?
Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe if hackers access the database.
Privacy: Ensures user passwords aren‚Äôt visible to anyone.
Compliance: Follows security laws like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
Stops Password Theft: Encrypted passwords can‚Äôt be easily stolen or guessed.

Steps for Milestone 6 üìù
Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll cover in the live coding session:

Encrypt the Password:

Use bcrypt to hash the user's password during signup.
Save the hashed password in the database instead of plain text.
Store Complete User Data:

Save all the user's data (e.g., name, email, etc.) in the database while ensuring that the password remains encrypted.
In case you missed the mentor-led session, no worries! You can always go through the content and feel free to reach out to your mentor for help on the coding aspect.
Welcome to Milestone 9! üåü

Today, we will create a frontend form for taking products input. Let‚Äôs dive in and understand what this all means!

Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Learn how to create a form that will take all the details of product
Learn how to take multiple images as input.
Why Create Product form?
Here we will create an form to input all the details of product.
This details will be eventually saved in database and will be displayed on products home page we created in previous milestone.
Steps for Milestone 9üìù
Create the form for products

This form will take multiple product images images as input

Note:- This lesson will help you in understanding the basic creating of products please feel free to experiment on adding more features like creating an admin access and allow only admin to upload products or create and shop profile and a user with only shop profile can upload.
